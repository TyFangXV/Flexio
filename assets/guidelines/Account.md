# Account 

a user account is a set of credentials that can be used to access the system.

# Account access 

each user account has a set of access rights that determine what the user can do.

# How the client fetches the users data

when a user is registered to a client, the client ID and client secret will be stored (after encryption) locally which will let the api know that the client is verified to send the user data.
